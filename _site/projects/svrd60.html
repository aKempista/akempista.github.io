<p>The SVRD60 is a modular keyboard platform designed from the ground up. Starting with the PCB, a standard button matrix is used for the keyswitch layout. A USB hub integrated circuit was added to provide functionality to the removable modules.</p>

<p>Each module acts as separate USB device and must be programmed independently. While this might add more work to create each module, it makes the system less centralized and easier to add new modules without having to update the main module.</p>
