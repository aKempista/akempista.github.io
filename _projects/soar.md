*Project SOAR* was built as the capstone project of my undergraduate electrical engineering degree. It features a single board PCB design which includes a TP4056 based charging module, an ESP32, an FFC camera connection, and connections to the four individually controlled motors. The camera sends a live feed of images back to the host computer to be processed using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object recognition model. This project was a proof of concept for creating a low cost drone for automation or search and rescue tasks.
