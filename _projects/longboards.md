These longboards were created with a variety of methods, starting with creating an outline of the shape of the board, cutting multiple sheets of wood to match the footprint, and then gluing and pressing the boards into shape using a custom jig. Both laser cutters and traditional shop tools were used for construction.

The art of each board is designed as a vector graphic and then laser cut into a template or stencil to assist the paint process. The boards are then finished with a clear coat. Griptape is applied and potentially also laser cut to add personality to both sides of the board. The trucks and wheels used are standard components from companies such as BEAR and Sector9.
